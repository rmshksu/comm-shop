title: Keep It Simple, Stupid!
nav: KISS

> “Don’t talk to the general audience as you would your scientific colleagues. There are terms that convey your meaning instantly and accurately to fellow experts. You may parse these phrases every day in your professional work. But they do no more than mystify an audience of non-specialists. Use the simplest possible language. Above all, remember how it was before you, yourself, grasped whatever it is you’re explaining.”  
> — Carl Sagan

Nobody wants to listen to a lecture when they were expecting a sales pitch.

Nobody's excited when a quick description becomes a novel.

Keep it simple, stupid.

## Start at the End: **What do you want?**

<div class="card mb-4">
  <div class="card-body">
    <p><strong>+</strong> I want everyone in the crowd to recognize:</p>
    <p>Learning isn't about getting the right answer.</p>
    <p>It's about failing until you understand.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Trim the Fat: **What are you really saying?**

<table class="table table-bordered w-75 mx-auto">
  <thead class="thead-light">
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Symbol</th>
      <th scope="col">Message</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="badge bg-secondary">N</span></td>
      <td>I want everyone in the crowd to recognize</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="badge bg-success">+</span></td>
      <td><strong>Learning</strong> isn't about getting the right answer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="badge bg-danger">-</span></td>
      <td><strong>It's about failing until you understand</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Get to the Point: **What's the Underlying Theme?**

<div class="card text-center my-4">
  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="h4"><strong>Learning</strong>. It's about <strong>failing</strong> until you <strong>understand</strong>.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center gap-4 my-4">
  <div class="text-center">
    <div class="border p-3"><strong>Learning</strong></div>
