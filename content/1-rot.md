## Background  
**What are you presenting â€” and what does everyone need to know before you dive in?**

> *<mark class="highlight-prompt">Lehman Brothers</mark>* needed better <mark class="highlight-focus">Calculus</mark> teachers.

### Lehman Brothers Inc.
- Investment banking firm  
- Declared bankruptcy on <mark class="highlight-prompt">**September 15, 2008**</mark>  
  <span class="aside">Consider briefly explaining why this date is historically significant.</span>

### 2008 Collapse
- Global financial crisis  
- Massive stock market crash  
- Result of <mark class="highlight-summary">**predatory lending**</mark> and <mark class="highlight-summary">**subprime mortgages**</mark>  
  <span class="aside">Sometimes context is needed, but a rapid summary is more than enough for the presentation.</span>

### <mark class="highlight-focus">Calculus</mark>
- **Risk Management**: Controlling the chance of a bad financial outcome by using data and mathematics  
- **Derivatives**: The measure of how sensitive a function is to change  
  <span class="aside">When we have to give context to a very broad subject, try to narrow it down as much as possible.</span>

## Application  
**How is your idea applied or your product used?**

When assessing risk, we typically look at:
- The chance that bad things happen  
- How bad things can go  
- How good things should go  

> Lehman Brothers help us see that we should be just as worried  
> about how **sensitive** things are to change.

Any student with one semester of calculus can calculate the  
**risk measurement** that would have saved Lehman Brothers.

---

## Implication  
**What does your idea/product mean to the world, the population, and the audience?**

> When instructors teach calculus, they rarely emphasize applied use and exploration.  
> Calculus students rarely consider how vital the class could be to their lives.  

Instructors need to teach with the urgency that  
they could be responsible for a global recession.  
Students need to take their lessons more seriously than Lehman Brothers did.
