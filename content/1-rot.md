> **Lehman Brothers Inc. took an extremely risky market position**

## Application  
**How is your idea applied or your product used?**

When assessing risk, we typically look at:
- The chance that bad things happen  
- How bad things can go  
- How good things should go  

> Lehman Brothers help us see that we should be just as worried  
> about how **sensitive** things are to change.

Any student with one semester of calculus can calculate the  
**risk measurement** that would have saved Lehman Brothers.

---

## Implication  
**What does your idea/product mean to the world, the population, and the audience?**

> When instructors teach calculus, they rarely emphasize applied use and exploration.  
> Calculus students rarely consider how vital the class could be to their lives.  

Instructors need to teach with the urgency that  
they could be responsible for a global recession.  
Students need to take their lessons more seriously than Lehman Brothers did.
