"Good design is making something intelligible and memorable. Great design is making something memorable and meaningful." - Dieter Rams

## Engage with the Audience

>It takes a village

- Make the audience feel like they were involved

>Silence is just an effect

- The first one to talk, buys

>Live performances should be alive

- You should be able to go off script and/or abandon visual aids

<br>

## Let the Audience Engage with the Content

>Ditch the jargon

- You have to translate before you can communicate

>Let go of the rigor

- Everyone assumes you're the expert. You dont need to prove yourself you need to be heard.

>Turn the listeners into collaborators

- The audience should have questions **and comments** they didn't arrive with

<br>

## Make them Care

>What's in it for **them**?

>How can **they** contribute?

>If there's no point to your presentation, then there's no point to remember it.
